Migrate 2.5
===========

IMPORTANT: Automatic registration of new migration classes is no longer done on
a cache clear. Depending on automatic registration is now deprecated, and you
are encouraged to implement your migrations as DynamicMigration and explicitly
register them via hook_migrate_api() or MigrationBase::registerMigration().
If your migrations are not explicitly registered, you must request auto-registration
with a "drush mar" (drush migrate-auto-register) command, or by clicking the
"Register" button at admin/content/migrate/registration.

Bug fixes
- #1827052 - Properly check for bad XML.

Features and enhancements
