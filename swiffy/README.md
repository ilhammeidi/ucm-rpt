This folder contains the [Swiffy] (https://www.google.com/doubleclick/studio/swiffy/) versions of the Flash files.

* Swiffy doesn't support drag and drop, so we used the original Flash files when drag and drop was needed.
* The HOT TIPS (*_HT_*) are no longer used. They were converted to HTML included in the tutorial pages that need them.
