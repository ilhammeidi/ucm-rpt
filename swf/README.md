This folder contains the original Flash files. 
* Most of these Flash files have been converted to HTML using [swiffy](https://www.google.com/doubleclick/studio/swiffy/). Swiffy doesn't support drag and drop, so we used the original Flash files when drag and drop was needed.
* All the HOT TIPS (*_HT_*) were converted to HTML and CSS.
